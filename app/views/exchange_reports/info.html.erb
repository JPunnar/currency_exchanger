      <p>This is a web app that helps You to decide when to exchange money
      from one currency to another.</p>
      <p>Written using Ruby on Rails framework.</p>
      <p>Rails version: <strong>5.1.5</strong></p>

      <p>This means that speed and reliability grow with use.</p>
      <strong>NB! This app is not intended for real-world use; The prediction algorithm simply uses randomness.</strong>
